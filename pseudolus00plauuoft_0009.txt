PREFACE.

THE Text of this edition is in the main that of Ussing,
to-whose edition as also that of Lorenz I am considerably
indebted for notes and references.

Through the great kindness of Prof. Leo of Gettingen

who sent me proof-sheets of his recension of the Pseudolus
I have been able in several passages to avail myself of the

results of his careful criticism of the Text.
