INTRODUCTION.

ξ 1. ROMAN COMEDY.

Roman Comedy, or, more properly speaking, Latin Comedy,
is in the main an adaptation of the N ew Comedy of the Greeks
to Roman needs3 but there are Italian factors in its develop-
ment, notably Versus Fescennz’m‘, Saturae, fabulae Atellanae.
The following then are the stages of its growth‚ in chronological
order.

Ι. Versus Fescennini, from Fescennium in Etruria, personal
and scurrilous extempore dialogue, said to have been put down
by law. Cf. Hor. Ep. 2. 1. 145,

Fescennina per hunc invecta licentia morem
versibus alternis opprobria rustica fudit,
libertasque recurrentes accepta per annos
lusit amabiliter, donec iam saevus apertam
in rabiem coepit verti iocus et per honestas
ire domos impune minax.

Metre Saturnian, vid. ξ 3.

ΙΙ. Saturae, scenes from daily life, impletae modis, descrfflto
ad tibicinem cantu (Liv. 7. 2), i.e. properly set to music. Made
up of (a) Versus Fescenuini, (β) the Etruscan mimic dance to
flute accompaniment without words. Liv. 7. 2, Ludioues ex
Etruria acciti,- in 364 B.C. to avert a pestilence.

111. Atellanae fabulae, from Atella, an Oscan town in Carn-
