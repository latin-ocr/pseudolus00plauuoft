Titus Maccius Plautus (plautus, Umbrian plotus=flat-foot)‚
born at Sarsina in Umbria 264 B.C. Came to Rome early,
employed as assistant of the stage-carpenters and scene-shifters.
While thus employed he saved a little money, which he lost in
foreign trade. Returned to Rome and worked in a mill (pis-
trinum). Literary activity from circ. 234 to 204 B.C. Died in
184 B.C.

Most of his plays are adapted from those of Diphilus,
Philemon, Menander and Demophilus. Two Greek plays
sometimes amalgamated into one Latin play (Contamz'rzatz'o),

the plot of the second play being used merely as an episode
in the contaminated play.
