ξ 3. METRE AND PRosonv.

Rhythm is defined as ‘The dividing of speech according to
the time taken to pronounce its component parts) It depends
on the following facts:

(i) Human speech is divided into syllables, words, breath-
groups, sentences.

(ii) Human speech has an accent (σημασία) on words and
sentences.

(iii) The time that the voice dwells on the different syllables
of a word varies, i.e. the quantity is sometimes long, sometimes
short. The short syllable, which contains one ‘time' (mora,
tempus) is taken as the time-unit. It is called χρόνος πρῶτος.

In a series of time-units there is always a σημασία (percussio,
ictus), an accent, i.e. in a regular succession one unit is em-
phasised more than another ; or, in other words, there is a con-
tinual succession of ἄρσις and θέσις. Α group of units under
One σημασία is called ποῦς, a fOOt.

The stages of development of Roman metre may be best
marked off as follows:

1. Numerus Italicus, found in old formulae, legal or religious
(carmina). Nature uncertain, but note (a) aecem, probably four
raisings of the voice, (β) alliterati0n1.

Cf. Cato de re rustica 141 :

Mars pater te precor Ι quaesoque liti sies Ι volens
propitius Ι mihi domo Ι familiaeque nostrae.

II. Saturnian metre (fannius, saturnius versus), used for
songs, carmina, proverbs, epitaphS, dedications, etc.; also for
larger poems, eg. of Ennius3 it was considered a national
mette, and continued in use even after the introduction of
Greek metres.

Eg. epitaph of the Scipios

Hanc einom ploz'rume Ι cosentiont Romane
duonorom optumam Ι sulse vz'rom virorem

¹ Alliteration is a common feature of early metres: cf. Langland,
Piers Plowman, “ In a somer seson when soote was the sonne,'' etc.
