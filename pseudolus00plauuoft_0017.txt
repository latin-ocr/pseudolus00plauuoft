Lucio* Scipionem. Ι Filios Barbati

Conso! censor azdz'lls Ι lzz'c suet apud vos;
laec cepit Corsicam Ι A lariumque urbem,
dedet Tempestatebus Ι aidan* merelod votam.

Cf. F. D. Allen, Rernnants of Early Latin, p. 23.

N ote (a) caesura ; (β) alliteration3 (γ) accent3 sometimes
making a short syllable long, eg. censor. Cf. virum mila· Camena
insece versutum, Livius Andronicus, Odyss. l. 1 ; (ὃ) approach to
quantity-system.

111. Free imitation of Greek metres‚ traces of old systems
always apparent, thus equivalent to a quantity metre with ac-
centual influence. Livius Andronicus, Naevius, Plautus, Terence.

For details vid. ξ 4.

ss IV. More exact imitation of Greek metres3 quantity—rhythm‚
e.g. hexameters (Vergil) etc.

ξ 4. Most of the difficulties of Plautine scansion come under
the following heads:

Ι. Long syllables are shortened by presence of accent:

II. Short syllables are lengthened by absence of accent:
often in both cases where etymologically jusdfiable, eg. fateor,
rete, egb, etc.‚ all originally long syllables, which were shortened in
the Augustan age. Similarly final -s and —m are almost entirely
neglected3 cf. the fact that -m is often omitted in inscriptions
(vid. ξ 3), and for -s cf. Ennius:

tum lateralis dolor certissumus nuntius mortis,

and Lucretius, passim.

III. Hiatus is permitted where there is a pause in the sense,
or a division of the verse. This is natural in spoken lines.

IV. ‘Length by position’ does not exist in Plautine scansion.
This corresponds to popular usage which was vague 3 note here

(a) m had a weak sound (vid. supra), hence omnis, ne'mpe.

(β) Double letters were not written till Ennius’ time3 cf.
Sc. de Bacch. fzczlve=fuzksa

(γ) Very common words, e.g. esse, ille, ergo were probably
