study its development from the inscriptions of the C. 1. L. to
the ‘Lives’ of Suetonius, spending time especially on ,those
authors whose works seem typical or epoch-making in the
building-up of the Latin language, and in this category Plautus
stands preeminent. Evolution applies to speech as much as to
zoology3 speech like the universe of the Ionic philosopher ἀεὶ

- ῥεῖ, ἀεὶ γίγνεται. Thus the study of Grammar must be Hz'storz'c.

Grammar is usually defined as the study of certain linguistic
phenomena, the morphology of speech, in one language3 if in
more, it is Comparative ¹Grammar. These phenomena differ
(ι) temporally‚ (2) locally, (3) according to the ‘individual
speaker (stylism), cf. e.g. Thucydides, Cicero, Sophocles (e.g. in
such phrases as μυρίου χρόνου). The tempora] differences are
the greatest, hence the axiom stated above, All true study of lan·
guage must be on the historical method. The great hindrance
to the adoption of these principles lies in the preconceived no-
tions of so-called Rules, carefully fostered by a continual diet
of Cicero and Livy, and the demands of Latin Prose Com-
position. The word Rule is too often misused: we talk of ‘a
rule of Latin Syntax‚' whereas weought strictly to say that ‘at
such and such a time in such and such a place most Romans
expressed themselves in such and such a manner.² That the
elairns os Historic grammar are recognized hy most scholars
now is amply evidenced by the change in the point of view from
which most modern grammars are written, a change which has
its ‘fons et principium’ in Drager’s Historische Syntax der
Lateinischen Sprache (Ist Edit. 1878).

Plautus, ‘who by his intelligent adaptation of the unformed
Latin idiom contributed so much towards the development of
the Latin language,² is indispensable for the historic study of
Latin, not only for syntax-development, but also ⁸1'orthe history
of words, for the knowledge of their original fundamental
meanings, without which that ὀρθοέπεια, the correct use of words
on which the Greeks laid so much stress, is impossible. The
advantages of reading Plautus lie in the following points:

i. He represents an older stage of language: with the ex-
ception of the fragments of Ennius he is the only literary
