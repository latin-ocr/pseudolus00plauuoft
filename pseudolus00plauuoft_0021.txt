representative of what may hex called Old Latin: his position in

the history of the Latin language is very much that of Homer
for the Greek language, e.g. his constructions are simpler, and
his uses of words are nearer to the original meaning.

ii. Plautus' language is colloquial, it represents the talk of
the common people at Rome, the ‘Vulg‘arsprache’ as opposed to
the ‘ Schriftsprache' of the educated classes and lz'ttdratenrs.

iii. It follows from the fact that Plautus’ speech is colloquial
that it is also preeminently natm-al, untouched by stylism and
artificiality. The importance 'of realizing this in studying any
language historically is evident. Language is one of the many
ways of expressing thought: a prominent idea or relation of
ideas occurs in the thinker’s mind which he wishes to express to

his hearer: the process is not thought out, except so far as is γ

necessary for clear expression: if the hearer understands, the
speaker has attained his object, even though the ‘linguistic
expression* of the psychic relation' may be apparently ‘ungrani-
matical.' Language is reasonable.

iv. The parallels to Plautine language are well-marked and
accessible‚ viz. Cicero in his Letters‚ especially the Epistolae¹ ad
Atticum, and Lucretius. Terence is only apparently parallel, as
a recent1 writer on Latin grammar has shewn; The best idea
of the speech of the educated upper classes at Rome is derived
from a careful comparison of Terence with Plautus on the one
hand, on the other Cicero, for it is between these two that Terence
holds a middle place ; the literary circle in which Terence moved
made it their express object to polish and elaborate the Latin
language, and there is a touch of truth in Cicero’s tale that Laelius
was said to have written Terence's plays ; for it was undoubtedly
to such men as Laelius and Scipio that Terence owed the
elegance ‘of his style.

’ In 'Appendix A are given schemes of the development of the
. more common constructions‚ and in the notes frequent allusion
is made to the value of a passage or a word historically. It
will be found that the chief contributions of Plautus to historic
