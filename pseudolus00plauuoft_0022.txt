grammar affect (a) the development of hypotaxis from parataxis‚
and (β) the history of the pronouns. But there is one danger of
Historic syntax against which perhaps a warning is necessary:
it is this, the explanation of the origin of a type in language
must not be pressed into every case, eg. metuas ne veniats
originally two coordinate statements, “let him not come 3 I am
anxious about it‚” becomes in time a dependent construction
(hypotaxis), but we must not say that wherever we find ne with
verba metuendi, that two coordinate sentences actually stand
before us ; *rather it is a type which originated from such sen-
tences. ⁷

Historic grammar, though studied merely in its outlines‚
should serve to emphasize two points which boys at school are
apt not to grasp: they are these:

A. Language is always moving, always being evolved.

Β. Language is sensible.

ξ 7. Α second point to which attention ought always to be
paid in reading Plautus, and‘which is emphasized in both the
notes and Appendix B, is the continuity of colloquial Latin,
the fact that the talk of the common people at Rome, the ‘Vulgar-
sprache,' pursued the even tenor of its way untouched by
the tyranny of ‘Ciceronz'anzzvmusss though perhaps temporarily‘
obscured. Cicero himself recognizes the distinction between
written Latin and colloquial Latin, as also do Quintilian,
Isidorus of Seville and the later grammarians, all of whom
mention¹ frequently sermo quotidianus, proletarius, rusticus,
vulgaris, militarit. This undercurrent of popular Latin, which
had its own laws and was not subject to the changing literary
fashions, can be traced from the Old Latin Inscn'ptions, such as
the epitaph of the Scipios or the Senatus-consultum de bacana-
libus, through Ennius, Plautus, Cato, the graffiti on the walls of
Pompeii, Petronius, the ecclesiastical writers, to finally the
Romance languages; while even in those writers who cultivated
the pura et incorrupta consuetudo Latinitatis we find construc—
tions and words which must be referred for their explanation to
colloquial Latin: e.g. in Horace's Satires and Cicero's Letters, ,
