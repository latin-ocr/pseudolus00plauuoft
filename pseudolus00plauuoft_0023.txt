such usages as non for ne with imperatives, quz's=uter‚ indica-
tive where subjunctive is expected, etc. (vid. Appendix B). A due
appreciation of this colloquial Latin always running parallel to
the more artificial Latin of the Augustan writers will prevent mis-
use of that much-employed grammatical explanation ‘Grecism,'
which is osten pressed too far, e.g. with regard to the use of
the infinitive. In colloquial Latin the infinitive (a dative of a
verbal noun)*was used to denote the direction of a movement,
the so-called final infinitive‘, and of this use Plautus, and in a
less degree Lucretius, give us several examples; it also occurs
in Vergil, Propertius (Ι. 1. 12), Horace (Odes) and Ovid (Heroid.
1. 37), in all of which writers it is not a ‘Grecism' but a ‘collo-
quialism.' Similarly in Old Latin the indicative is found in
indirect questions, i.e. the relation of the question to the main
sentence is independent, a type which goes back to a paratactic
original. Cf. Plaut. Most. 1172 viden ut adstat surcz'fer, etc.
’ But the indicative also occurs sporadically in the Classical prose
writers, e.g. Cic. Att. 13. 18 vides propinquitas quid habe& whilst
in Catullus, Vergil, and especially Propertius, it is comparatively
common, and the sermo plebeius of Petronius and Vitruvius
prefers the indicative. These instances again are mere col-
loquialisms, cf. the grammarian Diomedes (date 375 A.D.), who
commenting on nescia quid sacis says eruditius enim dicetur
‘nescio quid sacz'asl,' where nescio quid facis represents the
ordinary usage of popular Latin. ’

Α5 Diez first shewed, it is from this popular Latin that the
Romance languages are derived, and as Plautus represents a
large link in the chain of colloquial speech, his value cannot be
too much insisted upon as serving to connect the study of Latin
with that of Modern Languages. The first step towards under-
standing the development of the¹ Romance languages is to
reconstruct,as far as possible the popular Latin out of which
Π they grew; Plautus' contributions towards this are very large:
as shewn in more detail in the Appendix Β it is not only from
his actual (i) colloquialisms, but also (ii) his metre and (iii) his
spelling, that we derive assistance.
