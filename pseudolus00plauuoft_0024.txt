§ 8. The Argument of the Pseudolus 1s as follows: Calidorus,
a weak— minded but good· natured young Athenian, is in love
with a flute- girl Phoenicium, at present in the possession of a
pander Ballio. The latter had promised to give her to Calidorus
for 20 minae, which sum Calidorus is unable to raise: in spite
however ofhis promise Ballio is about to sell Phoenicium to a
certain miles who has already paid 15 minae: the remaining five
minae the miles, who is compelled to leave Athens, is to send
by one of his servants, who is at the same time to produce a
letter and symbcdum (signet) from his master. Calidorus hearing
of this is naturally idn despair, and the play opens with a dialogue
between Calidorus and his confidentia] slave Pseudolus, in which
the slave bids his master cheer up, as by some means or other
he is determined to get the necessary 20 minae and buy the
girl. [Scene 1.]

Scene II. consists mainly of a canticum (i.e. a monologue in
recitative) (ll. 13 3—2 30) by Ballio, who gives various instructions

device. At this point enter Simo, father of Calidorus, and his
old friend Callipho, returning from the market-place together.
Pseudolus withdraws and listens to their moralising for a while3
he then advances and states his case boldly, that he wishes to
borrow the 20 minae from either Simo or Callipho. Simo,
astonished at his impudence, not only refuses, but promises
Pseudolus his freedom if he can perform such an impossible
task. The good-natured Callipho, interested in the intrigue,
promises his help. Simo goes off to warn Ballio. [End of
Act I.] Act ΙΙ. begins with a short canticum by Pseudolus ex-
pressing his confidence in his own plans. At this point Harpax,
a slave of the miles, arrives with a letter instructing Ballio to
hand over Phoenicium to him. Pseudolus, pretending that he is
Ballio’s slave, says that his master is not at home, persuades
Harpax to give him the letter, while the latter retires to a
