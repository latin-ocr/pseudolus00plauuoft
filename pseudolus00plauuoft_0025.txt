neighbouring inn to rost after his jonrney. This piece of good
fortune is the motive for a philosophisingbmonologue by Pseu-
dolus on Luck in general. Calidorus 'returns from the market
bringing with him his friend Charinus, who supplies him with
the 5 minae. After an animated conversation Charinus and
Calidorus go off to hire some lounger (sycophanta) to personate
Harpax, and get Phoenicium from the leno, whilst Pseudolus
goes to the market to wait for and give instructions to this
pseudo-Harpax who appears in the person of Simia. Act III.
The interval in the development of the piece'is filled up by two
scenes which are really character-sketcheS, and do not affect the
action of the play in any way. In the first, a young slave comes
from Ballio's house and complains of the hardships of slave-life
generally; in the second Ballio returns from the market with a
cook whom he has hired, and discourses 0n2the character of cooks
in general, and this cook in particular. Act IV. Simia, dressed
as Harpax the mile? servant, receives Phoenicium from Ballio
and hands her over to her lover, Calidorus. Ballio very self-

incredulous promises him 20 minae if it is otherwise. Now
follows the catastrophe 3 the true Harpax appears on the scene,
the secret is out, and the pander is compelled to pay 15 minae
to the miles. Act V. Pseudolus returns very drunk after
dining with Calidorus, asks Simo for the 20 minae he had
promised him if his plan succeeded3 Simo pays, and joins
Calidorus and the rest of the company in the usual convivium.

ξ 9. The MSS. of Plautus give no divisions into Acts, only
into Scenes, which are marked by Tituli, i.e. the names of the
interlocutors for the next scene, eg. Pseud. 414, Simo, Callipho,
senes dno, Pseudolus servm, or not unfrequently merely by a
blank space. Plays were acted without intervals, save probably
where an actor had to leave the stage to return in a new
character, in which case flute—players (Tibicines, αὐληταὶ) per-
formed. Cf. Pseud. 576

...non ero vobis morae,
Tibicen vos interca hic delectaverit.
