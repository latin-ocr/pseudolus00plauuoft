Roman comedy probably depended more on the stage-manager
than on the poet. These pauses gradually became fixed, and
gave rise to the conventional 5 acts of comedy (cf. Hor. A. P.
189 f.). But the exact division of Plautine plays into Acts pro-
bably arose with scholars of the Renaissance. The divisions
into cantica and diverbia are as old as the plays themselves.
The canticum was usually a monologue (μονῳδία), recitative
with flute accompaniment, with suitable gestures and possibly
dancing: the metres of the cantica are very complicated, and
correspond to the feelings of the speaker. The diverbz'um is
the ordinary dialogue‚ with no music, usually in iambic senarii.

The following is a synopsis of the play according to the received
division of Acts and Scenes.
