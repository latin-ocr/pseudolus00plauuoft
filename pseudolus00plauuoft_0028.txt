the play was acted were those celebrated in 191 B.C. on the
occasion of the completion of the Temple, which was begun in
204 13.C.‚ to receive the statue of the Magna Mater Idaea (μεγάλη
μήτηρ) which in obedience to an oracle had just been brought to
Rome from Pessinus in Asia Minor. Cf. Livy XXXVI. 36. 3
“Aedes matris magnae Idaeae dedicata est....Dedz'cavz‘t eam
M. lunius Brutus, ludique ob dedicationem eius sacti quos
primos scenicos fluisse Valerius Antias est auctor Megalesia
appellatos.”

ξ 12. The Pseudolus has been well described as festiva
admodum alque optime morata sabula, and most critics give it
a place among the five best plays of Plautus; that the author
himself had a high opinion of this work of his later years (he
was at the time 60 years of age), Cicero tells us in Cat. mai. 14.
50 quam gaudebat bello suo Punico Naevius, quam Truculento
Plautus, quam Pseudolo! In another well-known passage (Cic.
pro Rosc. Com. 7. 20), after describing Roscius' skill in acting the
part of a leno, he says that his representation of such a ‘Ballio'
(the pander in this play) was a living picture of the accuser Chaerea
cuius personam praeclare Roscius in scena tractare consuevit
neque tamen pro beneficio ei par gratia refertum· nam Ballionem
illum improbissimum lenonem cum agit, agit Chaeream.

The Pseudolus has been frequently imitated by modern
playwrights, eg. the Italian Battista Porta in ίΙῖε. Trappoleria.'
Moliere too drew largely on this play for L’Etourdi‚ as also
Regnard for La Serenade, and the Diderich Menschenschreck
of Holberg is largely derived from the same source.

The small amount of appreciation which the Pseudolus has
met with in England is surprising‚ as in the verve of its dialogue,
and brisk well-concerted action, it is certainly superior to most
dramas of Plautus. The freshness of detail with which Pseu-
dolus’ cheerful confidence and Ballio's absolute unscrupulous-
ness are described, the picture of Harpax's simplicity and
Simo's greed‚ the human interest which runs through the whole
play, and keeps the sympathy of the audience to the end‚—all
mark out the play as worthy of a more careful study than has
usually been accorded it in this country.
