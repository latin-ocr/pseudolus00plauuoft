INTRODUCTJON. xxv

The expositio or explanation of the plot (ll. 1—576) is un-
usually clear, and forms an excellent introduction to the fuller
development of the play in 577—9o7‚ the Involutio. In Act I.
Sc. 2 (ll. 133—253) where Ballio is addressing his slaves we
have a noticeable parallel to Shakespeare's Pericles, Act IV.

As stated above, the original of the play is unknown3 most
probably Plautus made use of more than one play in composing
the Pseudolus; this we infer from the entire disappearance of
Callipho, from the great difference there is between the Simo
of the last act and the Simo of the first; the cook scene also

Act ΙΙΙ. Sc. 2 <794—907) seems to be taken in its entirety from

an original other than that of the rest of the play. Act II. Sc. 2 ,·

(dialogue, Pseudolus deceiving Harpax) is very Greek, as also
V. 1, where the drunken Pseudolus expostulates with his feet;
butthe scene which is most Greek in content and phraseology
is 311. 2, the conversation between Ballio and his new cook.
The parts of the Pseudolus which seem most thoroughly Latin
and to be Plautus' own independent work are Act Ι. (the
Expositz'o), II. 3, Pseudolus on good luck, and the second scene
of Act V. (the conclusion of the piece); sor in all of these may be
noted as Latin characteristics (a) legal and military allusions,
(β) paucity of Grecisms, (γ) puns, paronomasia, plays on words,
(ὃ) alliteration, rhyme, assonance. For a more detailed account
of the application of such criticism to Plautus’ plays vide Lorenz,
Introductions to the Miles Gloriosus, and the Pseudolus.

ξ 13. MANUSCRIPTS OF THE PSEUDOLUS.

The Ambrosian palimpsest (A) originally contained the
Pseudolus on 41 pages, but unfortunately 8 have been lost,
while on the remainder 33 several lines or parts of lines are
illegible3 the 8 lost pages contained lines 235—-264, 476-554,

747-820, 1015—-1049‚ 1084—1121‚ 1256—1285 : for these we rely
on B and C 3 cf. Lowe, Anal. Plautin. p. 149 foll.

ξ 14. DRAMATIS PERSONAE.

Calidorus, a young Athenian gentleman.
Pseudolus, his confidential slave.
