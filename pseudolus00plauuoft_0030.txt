Calidorus (MSS. sometimes Calydorus)=apparently Καλί·

2 ὃωρος ‘giver of good gifts' as a lover. Dress: pallium, tunica3

black hair, pale complexion.

Pseudolus=probably a Greek form ψευδύλος (ψεύδειν) a de-
ceiver; the spelling Pseu-dolus from popular etymology con-
necting the name with Lat. dolus. Dress: tunica3 hair bright
red, complexion florid.

Ballio; Cf. Athen. IV. 166 Πυθοδήλου τινὸς ἀσώτου μνημονεύει
Ἀξιόνικος ἐν Τυρρηνῷ οὕτως ‘0 Πυθόδηλος οὑτοσὶ ὁ Βαλλίων προσ-
έρχεται. The name itself seems to have contained some element
of abuse3 it is possibly connected with the word βάλλιον, un-
known to lexicographers until its discovery in Herondas (VI. 69).
Appearance revoltingly ugly, tunic and cloak old and dirty
(l. 983), hirquina barba (972), bald and without eyebrows, walks
like a crab (960). It is probable that the proverbial use of
Ballio as the ne plus ultra of rascality, of which Cicero gives
several instances, was not originated by this play, but merely
enhanced and popularised by it 3 cf. Cic. Philipp. ΙΙ. 6. 15, Hodie
non descenditAntonius. C ur? Dat nataliciam in hortis. Cui?
lVeminem nominabo: putate tum Phormioni alicui, tum Gnathoni
(cf. Ter. Phorm. and Eun.), tum etiam Ballioni. Cic. Pro Rosc.
Com. 17. 50 a Ballione aut aliquo eius simili. Ibid. 7. 20.
