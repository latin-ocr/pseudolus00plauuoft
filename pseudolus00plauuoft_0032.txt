The Time is the day immediately preceding the Great Dio-
nysia, which were usually held between the 8th and 18th of
Ἐλαφηβολιών (=second half of March and first half of April).
The action of the play begins in the morning3 almost all the
characters, Ballio, Simo, Calidorus, Charinus and Pseudolus
have visited the market‚ the common morning occupation of an
Athenian. Towards midday Harpax arrives (1178 ad mem‘dz'em),
goes to a taberna sor prandium and a siesta3 when he returns
he says 1161 vides iam diem multum esse? i.e. that it is the
middle of the asternoon.

Of the Didascalia (διδασκαλία, announcement) the Ambrosian
palimpsest gives two lines, which were deciphered by Ritschl.
‘Marcus Junius Brutus, son of Marcus, was city-praetor in
191 B.C.’ The most complete διδασκαλία is that which precedes
the Stichus-‚3 it is as follows:

Ι 1Graeca Adelphoe Menandru Ι 2acta ludis plebeis
Ι ³Cn. Baebio L. Terentio Aed. Pl. Ι 4[egit] . . .
Ι ⁵C. Publilius Pollio Ι ⁶[m0dos fecit] marcipor Oppii
Ι ⁷tibiis Sarranis totam Ι
Ρ. Sulpicio C. Aurelio Cos.

‘In Greek the “ Brothers'' of Menander. Acted at the plebeian
games when Cn. Baebius and L. Terentius were plebeian aediles;
C. Publilius Pollio acted . . . 3 Marcus Oppius’ freedman . . . set
the whole play to music for Tyrian flutes . . . in the consulship of
P. Sulpicius and C. Aurelius!
