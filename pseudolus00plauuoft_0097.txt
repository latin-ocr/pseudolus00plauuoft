ARGUMENT I.

Not in A. The acrostich arguments are the work of some late
grammarian, possibly Aurelius Opilius (flor. B.C. 100).
1. praesentis, ‘cash down‚' vid. note on l. 303.
miles, the Macedonian captain Polymachaeroplagides.
minas, a mina=78{ shillings or roughly ,ξφ
2. consignat symbolum, ‘puts his seal on a token‚’ an un-Plautine
phrase; Plautus usually uses consignare with tabellas, Bacch. 929,
Cure. 365, 369 etc. This ‘token‚' symbolus, is in the wider sense, the
letter to Ballio written by the miles and sealed with his signet3 thus
650 Tu epistulam lzanc a me accipe alque illi dato ; Ι Nam istic symbolust
inter erum meum et tuom de muliere. 657 Dato istunc symbolum.
1203 dedi...symbolum servo ίιιο, l mei eri imagine obsignatam epistulam.
In a more narrow sense symbolus is also used for the seal as distinct*
from the letter: cf. Plin. H. N. XXXIII. 1. (4) 10, who says that it=anulus,
just as σύμβολον εοῐτιεῐίηιεεεδακτύλιον. It is in this sense that Pseu-
dolus uses it 720 epistulam lianc modo intercepi et (pointing to it)
symbolum. So 989 nosce imaginem ; 1004 symbolust z'n epislula ; uideo
et cognosco signium· where the meaning is undoubtedly the impression
of· the signet, which usually was a representation of the owner himself.

Cf. Cic. In Catil. 111. 5. 10.
Α

3. qui eum: for the quantity cf. l. 7 quem z's. The scansion of the
arguments is very closely modelled on that of Plautus himself. There
are 30 similar instances in the Pseudolus.

relicuo, ‘the balance’: cf. Capt. prol. 10 Accipite relicuom; alieno
uti nil moror. Cist. I. 3. 40 qunc quod relicuom restat uolo persoluere:
ut expungatur nomen ne quid debeam. Cf. too reliqua in Cic. ad Att.
xv. 15. 3, XVI. 15. 5, VI. 1. 19. ‘The balance' in this case was 5 minae,
cf. l. 51. RZli‘cz'c‘a‘s is almost always quadrisyllabie in the dramatists, in
