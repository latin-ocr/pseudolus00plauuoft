with such fondness is of the rarest possible occurrence, even in the most

PROLOGUE.

The Prologue is not by Plautus himself, but written for some repre-
sentation of the play after his death. The last verses probably suggested
that those of the audience who were hungry or had business should
dcpart3 or we may perhaps compare the old catch

“...is he cannot play or sing
ἡ but only comes to talk...
let him take his hat and wa1k.”

In which case cf. Mil. prologue 81 qui aulem auscultare nolet exsurgat
foras.

1. exporg-1‚ ‘get up and stretch your legs’: cf. Epid. ad fin. lumbos
porgite atque exsurgite.

exsurgier is thus passive.

2. Plautina fabula, cf. Casina prologue η. For longa cf. 389 sat
sic longae fiunt' fabulae.

PSEUDOLUS.

4. miseriae misere macerent. For the phrase cf. Mil. 613, Poen.1v.
1. 2, Cist. 1. 1. 78. For the assonance cf. in this play 71 sciui—scires,
192 malo male, 648 opportunz'las-opporlunius—opportune, 1012 capta
praeda capti praedones etc. Lorenz holds that these alliterations are
peculiarly Latin, and that the scenes which contain most instances are
consequently more genuinely Plautine than the others, vid. Introd. ἓ 12.
v 5. duorum, dissyllabic by synizesis. This scansion makes the
transition of du to d and later b more intelligible. duo—bis, cf. duellum
—bellum, duonor0(m) [epitaph of Scipios]-—l10nus etc. For the mere
synizesis cf. next line mei, 11 tm* etc., vid. Introd. ἓ 4. 6.

misissem, a perfect parsi occurs in Plautus by the side of the
Augustan peperci, both forms probably being in use in colloquial
Latin.
