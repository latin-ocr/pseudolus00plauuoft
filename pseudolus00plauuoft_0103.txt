45. salutem, in two senses, ‘greeting‚’ and ‘safety,' ‘salvation.’

Trans. ‘kindly greeting,' ‘kindly aid.' For a similar conceit cf. Ov. ¹

Trist. 111. 3. 87
accipe supremo dictum milzz· forsitan ore,
quod, tibi qui mittit, non lzabet ipse, uale-

48. sis=sl uis.

geras, deliberative, ‘you possibly might do.‘

49. faxo scies: forfaxo vid. 14. For the parataxis vid. Appendix Α,
and cf. 61, 387, 390, 766, 1039, 1043, 1328. The stages of develop-
ment of such sentences may be roughly given thusz

Ι. saxo: scies, ‘I will bring it about3 you shall know.’
ΙΙ. saxo: scias,

ΙΙΙ. saxo scias,

IV. saxo ut scias, lit. ‘I will bring it about; in some way you
shall know.’

50. usus inuento. Cf. Asin. 310 nunc audacia usust nobis z'n—
uenta et dolis; Bacch. 749 quid istis ad istunc usust conscriptis modum?
With pronouns in such instances as Amph. 501 quod non factost usus,
Cas. 563 quodfacto est opus, Ter. Hec. 978 quodfacto usus sit, it is
uncertain whether quod is the abl. (quo-l-d, cs. med, extrad, red etc.) or
the nominative. In support of the latter hypothesis cf. senatusconsultum
apud Cic. Fam. VIII. 8. 5 siquid de ea re adpopulum...lato opus esset.

siet. The optative of sum in Latin was originally

siem simus
sies sitis
siet sient,

but the singular became sim on the analogy of the plural. cf. in
Greek

εἴην = *emma εἶμεν -- ὕέσῖμεν
εἴης = *e’otns εἶτε = *e’cfre
εἴη = '‘eamn-r) εἶεν for *elau = ἐσιαν (τ),

where the plural became εἴημεν on analogy of the singular.
51. peregre, ‘to be taken to foreign parts! peregre also osten
means, ‘from foreign parts ' 3 it is probably a syncretic case of pereger,
peregfi, abl. ‘from‘ } Ξ Augustan pereffra-
peregre, loc. ‘at’ and then ‘to' ὁ

52. minis. The Attic money-table was

6 obols = 1 drachma=about 95}st-
100 drachmae: 1 mina = ,‚ ,ξφ
60 minae = 1 talent = „ 25240.
