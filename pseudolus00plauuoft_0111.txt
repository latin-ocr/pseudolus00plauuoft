134. The repetition os -quam is probably intentional3 sor similar
assonances cf. Most. 913 umquam quicquam poslquam tuos sum, Ter.
Phorm. 348 enumquam quoiquam.

135. quibus; anacoluthon, we expect ‘uti non possum,’ but the
construction becomes passive, usmpari usura, as if quorum had pre-
ceded. Trans.: ‘whom, unless I treat them in this fashion (brandishing
the whip) Ι can make no use of.’

137. enim here seems to mean ‘f0r,' sor which we have no parallel
in Plautus; it usually is an affirmative particle strengthening what
precedeS, cf. 1. 3¹ immo enim perlegam: it is best consequently here to
refer it to line 135 in the sense of ‘indeed'

ingenio, ⁴ character!

edictionem...animum aduortetis, the accusative edictionem governed
by an. aduertelis. In criticising such constructions as this there are two
points to be remembered: (ι) that in the earlier stages of a language,
nouns (substantive or adjective) can govern an accusative or other case;
(2) that a compound expression often used lost its original construction
and thus produced a separate verb, eg. animum aduertere gave anz'mtid—
uertere, morem gerere gave momgerarz'. The following are some instance53
how far in each these two tendencies are fulfilled varies considerably.
