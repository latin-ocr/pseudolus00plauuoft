88 PSE UDOL US.

audio, ‘ Ι quite understand‚‘ ‘ I sreely admit it.‘ Cf. Cure. 610, Cic.
Rosc. Am. 18. 52.

295. omnes. The MSS. omit homines, probably owing to its simi-
larity, a case of lz'pography (λείπειν and γράφειν. The copyist writes the
first of two similar words, looks up, thinks he has already written the
second one and passes on).

296. nomen, ‘ why the very word ‘loan’ doesn’t exist now.' The
next line is supplied by Ussing to complete the sense. Ballio suggests
that on interest Cal. could have borrowed any money he liked3 Cal.
replies that the money-lenders won⁷t give him' credit.

298. isti. Plaut. has some special usurers in his mind whose names
he does not like to mention.

a mensa, sc. mgentm'z'a (cf. τραπεζίτης), ‘have given up banking.’
Versus obscurus ; fortasse a mensa surgunt ambiguo sensu ad sacra
pertinet, cf. Verg. Aen. 8. 109 cum schol. Leo.

satis poti: why well drunk? possibly with the blood of their

’ creditors; cs. hirudo, leech, applied to usurers by Cicero. Ussing

conjectures noti. In 192 B.C.‚ the year before the production of the
Pseudolus, there had been a great deal of feeling against the iniquities
of the money-lenders‚ resulting in several prosecutions; to these Plautus
probably alludes. Cf. Liv. XXXV. 41. 9 iudicia in faeneratores eo anno
multa seuere smztfacla,...de multa damnatorum quadrigae inauratae in
Capitolio positae et z‘n (clla Iouis supra fasligy'um aediculae duodecim
clzpea inaurata.

299. nato nemini, ‘not to a single soul,' ‘to never a mother's son.'
Cf. Most. 394, 442, Cas. 271.

302. argentaria, cf. 106 and Appendix B.

303. Ballio suggests another way of making money—by speculating
in crops. ‘Buy olive oil on a blind day and sell it on a day that has
eyes‚' probably expressions borrowed from the Exchange. caeca dies
seems to mean a day when the price cannot be soreseen, before it is
possible to tell how the crop will turn out. oculata. dies is the opposite,
when prospects and prices are certain. This method of doing business
was and is not uncommon, especially with cereals, and on the strength
of this Ussing suggests karnotinum=srunzentum‚ sc. huius anni
messem. Leo understands caeca dies as a day ‘qua tabernae clausae
sunt.’

305. lex, i.e. lex Plaetoria de cz'rczmtscrzptione adulescentium, ‘to
prevent the cheating of minors‚' by which the promises of one under
25 years of age were not binding. Cf. Rud. 1382, Cic. de nat. de· 111.
