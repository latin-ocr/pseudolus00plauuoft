340. frugi bonae, ‘you'll never be any good.’ frugi, as bonae
shews, is a dative, in later Latin it was regarded as indeclinable. Its
meanings were ‘ for food ” —› ⁴ sor service ' -> ‘ usesul '—› ‘ honest.’ The
dative is predicative; cf. Stich. 719 nulli rez' erimus, ‘ we shall be good
for nothing.' So probably the phrase soluendo esse, Cic. Att. X111. 16
soluendo non erat lllagz'us. Cf. Ov. Met. xv. 403, Liv. ιν. 35.

344. quo mod0‚ ‘what !’ in indignant surprise. Ballio chooses to ⁴
take it in the sense of ‘how‚' applied to the terms of sale, and continues
accordingly sine ornamentis etc„ a parody of a sale-formula. Ballio
means really ‘without her golden ornaments, just as she was ' (cf. Curc. ¹.
348), but he has in his mind terms of the sale of probably a house,
cum ornamenlz's‚ cum intestinis omnz‘busz‘with al'. its furniture and 3
inlaid work.’ For intestinum opus, λεπτουργία, cf. Varro R. R. 111. 1,
Plin. XVI. 42. 82. For the phrase cum ornamentis, used comically, cf.
Stich. 172 uenalis ego sum cum ornamentis omnibus.
