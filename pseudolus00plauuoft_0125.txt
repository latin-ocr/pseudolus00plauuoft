 

NOTES. 93

In my opinion uidetur nodum in scirpo inuenisse, and sicut, ‘since‚’
seems both natural and supportedlby parallels.

378. operae sl stt, ‘if Ι haste leisure': in no way connected with
the phrase est operae pretium, where operae: ‘ trouble‚' ‘ exertion.' For
opera in the sense of leisure‚ both in the genitive, as here, and the
nominative, cf. Mil. 254, 818, Truc. 870, Merc. 906, Liv. XXIX. 17. ¹7
(all operae est), Merc. 14, Cic. Q. Fr. 111. 4. 4 (opera est).

sit...10quar, we should expect esset...loquerer, but the present is used
sor the sake of vividness.

379. frustra esse, a common Plautine phrase for ‘to be deceived,
to be wrong.’ Cf. Amph. 967 etc. frustra (frauda srud-‚ cf. 1. 94),
always in Plautus, and once in Prudentius (St. 1. 13), has -ἅ short3 this
scansion, as so osten in old Latin metres, is justified etymologicaHy, as
originally fi‘ustrd was a neut. acc. plur. Cf. Stolz‚ Lat. Gr. in Mulier,
H. B. p. 342. For the construction cf. Drager, Hist. Syntax 1. p. 192 ᾗ,
who states that similar usages are frequent in Romance languages.

381. paulo post magis, sc. eris plenus negotii, i.e. Ι will soon give
you a good deal of trouble.

382. meus est, ‘I've got him) Cf. 604, 1126, Mil. 336, Naevius 70
deo meo propilio meus illic lzomost.

383. exossabo, ‘ 1’11 bone him.' Cf. Amph. 314 exossatum os esse
oportet. The verb is used of breaking bones so that they can be extracted.
Similar expressions borrowed from cooking are exenterare Epid„ con>
cidere aliquem Epid.

385. amoenare, ‘to besiege 'zmunz'mentis adire, i.e. uallo et fosso.

386. docto, ‘clever,' not ‘learned‚’ in Plautus.

388. faxo scies, cf. 49.

389. sat sic longae fiunt fabulae. sic=even without repetitions.
This is addressed to the spectators. Similar passages in which the
author or the actor takes the audience into his confidence are, in this
play 566 ᾗ, 1240 alio pacto quam in aliis comoediis fit, 1337 in crastinum
uos uocabo, in Poen. 919 quae audiuz'stz's modo si...iterem inscitia est,
Merc. 996, Cas. 917. Similarly Mil. 855, 1100, Men. 880 (appeals by
· an actor to the audience not to betray him), Aul. IV. 9, Cist. lv. 2,
where the actor asks the spectators to help him to find something. Cf.
Mere. 160, Most. 270, Bacch. 1005 etc.

392. utrumque=utrorumque‚ i.e. separate your trusty friends from
your untrustworthy ones. Leo takes this otherwise, ‘ Calidorus cunc-

tatur 3 Pseudolus eum utrumque facere iubet et paucorum ex multis
dilectum habere et ex dilectu unum seligere quo opus sit.' '
