rally3 both sentences belong to the same sphere of time. Connection
often loose. For instances cf. Trin. 103 haec quom audio in te dici,

Plautus uses the indicative always aster quom, whether temporal,
explicative, causal or concessive; the exceptions are only apparent, and
usually due to assimilation. But in Terence the subjunctive begins to
be more common (cf. the statement, Introd. §6, that Terence’s Latinity
is nearer to that of Cicero than of Plautus). Later, the subjunctive

· supplanted the indicative, without introducing any change of meaning.

Hoffmann (Die construction der Lat. Zeitpartikeln 73) gives the follow-
ing rule for the use of the subjunctive in ordinary Latin. Is the tz'me
of tlte subordinate sentence is strictly relative (i.e. if the cum-clause

ἦ· Uncertain, and chiefly caused by influence of some other con-
struction (assimilation).
