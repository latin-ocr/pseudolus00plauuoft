5⁷6. tibicen. This flute-player sat on one side of the proscenium,
and occasionally exchanged a few words with the actors, especially
those playing the slave—parts. Cf. Stich. 713, Cas. lv. 3. 13 cf. the
position of the buſjb in Italian opera. The object of this interlude was
to give the actors time to change their dress3 cf. Introd. ξ 9, As. 805.
With the exception of these intervals (which are very rare), Plautine
and Terentiam plays were acted without a break frorn beginning to end.

580. res perinde sunt. ut agas, ‘everything depends on the way
you do it, and the importance you attach to it.' Cf. Cic. de or. 111.
56. ²¹3 sed llaec omnia perinde sunt ut aguntur, ib. de off. 111. 33. 121,
Stich. 520, Ter. Heaut. 195.

581. copias. This canticum is full of military metaphors, which
are more frequent in the Pseudolus than in the other plays ; they were
particularly suited for a Roman audience, and may be regarded as quite
Plautus’ own.

583. maiorum, a seruus had no maiores, he was nullo patre.
A stock joke in Latin comedy. Cf. Cas. 395, Pers. 391, Capt. 574 etc.
Cf. infr. 590, where Pseudolus talks of his sellow-citizens (ciues), although
according to Roman ideas no slave ever possessed the ciuitas.

585. perduefflszlzostes. duellum is the older form of bellum.
Cf. duz'szbz's, Duelonai=Bellonae, duzdenmbidens: cf. Stolz H. Β.
p. 302. Notice that duell· is scanned as one syllable, Introd. ξ 4.

686. uostrorum=uestrum‚ cf. 185.

587. Ballionem exbauistabo. exballz'stare is formed by Plautus to
make a pun on Ballio's name,=to overthrow by means of a ballista3
paraphrase, ‘ upset the balance of....’

589. expugn0‚ we should expect expugnabo. Dr‘ager 11. p. 674
gives thirteen instances from Plautus (cf. Amph. 714, Men. 1071, Trin.
456), six from Lucr. and three from Cicero (Rep. 1. 34, ep. ad Brut.
1. 13, pet. cons. IX. 38). Nearly all these instances come under two
heads: (α) present to express immediate action, as here, ‘ if I storrn this
town, as I shall in a moment,' and (β) parenthetica] phrases, e.g. si uiuo,
nisi me animus fallit etc., which have become so stereotyped as to be
- unaffected by the construction of the sentence.

590. ciuibus, vid. 1. 583.

593. semul is scanned here and ¹330 as one syllable (Lorenz).
Cf. uinc(u)lum, extemp(u)l0‚ peric(u)lum, so old Spanish ‹en-semble,
ensembrcz, Ital. in·sembre‚ Fr. ensemble, vid. Appendix B.
