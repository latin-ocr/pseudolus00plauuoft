639. quid sor quod, strictly speaking3 but in this and similar
formulae quid always occurs. Cf. Amph. 360, infra 642, 656, 981,
capt. 284, 976, Trin. 889, Rud. 1160, Pers. 622.

For Syrus (properly ‘a Syrian’) as a slave-name cf. Lydus. The

645. misit redderezut redderem. The infinitive with verbs of
movement, instead of an ut-clause, is common in old Latin. Ennius
ann. 11. 337 duxit tolerare. In Plautus very frequent, e.g. Bacch. 351,
629, 8955 Cas. 656, Most. 64, Rud. 94, Truc. 402 etc. Only three
times in Terence. Not found in classical prose. In the poets not
uncommon, eg. Lucr. 1v. 473, Verg. Aen. 1. 527 populare penates
uenimus, Hor. Od. 111. 8. 11, Ovid Her. 1. 37. In Propertius more
frequent, e. g. 1. 6. 3 3 ibis carpere, vid. Drager 11. p. 550. These usages
are generally put down as Grecisms, but it should be remembered

(α) That this use of the infinitive is natural, for the infinitive is a
verbal noun in the dative, and the dative implies ‘corporeal inclination
towards a thing.'

(β) The evidence goes to shew that such uses existed in all colloquial
Latin, and continued to be used by the people even during the Augustan
period.

(γ) The explanation ‘Grecism’ may be safely applied to some
passages in Horace and Propertius, but should not on that account be
applied to all authors. Cf. Introd. ἓ 7.

650. rediero, ‘I'll be back at once,' cf. l. 334.
