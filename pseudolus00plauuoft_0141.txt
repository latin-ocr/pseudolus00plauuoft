NOTES. 109

Cicero (Catil. 111. 10. 22) talks scornfully of tunicae manicatae, as also
Hor. Sat. 1. 2. 2 5 of tunicae demissae.

743. aceti, properly vinegar, then ‘shrewdness‚' ‘biting wit,’=
acerbitas. Cf. Hor. Sat. Ι. 7. 32 at Graecus postquam est Italo perfusus
aceto, cf. Bacch. 402.

atque, ‘yes‚ and what's more.’ Cf. Mil. 369, Amph. 755, Cist. 11.
3. ⁴24, Epid. 111. 2. 44.

745. murrinam, sc. potionem,= μυρρίνης οἶνος, a drink which was
introduced into Rome from Magna Graecia. It was a sort of mead,
but non-alcoholie‚ and is the same as the uinum myrteum which Cato
(R. R. 125) mentions, i.e. a sweet drink made from the myrtle (μυρρίνη).
Cf. Pers. 87, Plin. H. N. x1v. 93, Gellius x. 23. 2.

passum, ‘raisin-wine’ made from uuae passae, which had been
spread out (pandere) to dry (or left on the stem) till they had lost half
their weight. The grapes or raisins were stoned, dipped in mustum,
then pressed3 from the juice of the first pressing passum proper was
made, from the second, secundarium (cf. δευτέρως οἶνος) passum. Cf.
Varro de vit. p. R. 1, Plin. H. N. XIV. 82, Verg. Georg. 11. 93.

defrutum (perhaps for dfirvitum, sc. mustum)=*‘must,' unser-
mented grape-juice, boiled down. The must, if boiled down to two-
thirds of its original weight, was called carenum, if to one-half,
defrutum, if to one-third, sapa; but authorities vary as to the use of
these terms. The result was a sort of very sweet grape-jelly. The
loci classici on the subject are Plin. H. N. XIV. 9, Colum. XII. 19,
Verg. Georg. 1. 269, IV. 296, vid. Smith, Dictionary of Antiquities‚
p. 1202. “

mellam= ‘ honey-water,’ ‘ mead.'

quoiuismodi = quoiusuz‘s modi = cuiusmodi. The history of the

form is doubtful. Lofrffz supposes that it arose through a slurring

pronunciation, thus quoiusuz's = qttoz'suz's = quoiuis.

746. pantopolium, so A according to L'owe. Other edd. thermo-
polz'um. Leo confirms pantopolz'um.

747. lamberaS, ἅπ. εἰρ., ‘you beat me at my own game‚' lit.=
scindere atque laniare, Festus.

748. Simia: sor the name vide Dram. Pers. ξ 14 Intr.

749. turbo, ‘a top,’ βέμβιξ. Cf. Verg- Aen. VH. 378 torto uolitans
sub uerbere turbo, Tib. Ι. 5. 3.

750. argutus, in two senses: (α) elever, shrewd, (β) perf. ptcpl.
pass. from arguo, ‘accused.’ ‘Has he lots of judgement?' ‘Judge-
ments, yes, any amount, and for heinous crimes t00.' Or possibly,
