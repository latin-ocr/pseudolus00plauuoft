and in a spirit coarser than is usual with him. Ussing well calls the lines
‘scena foedissima ct prorsus superuacanea.’

771. danunt, from an old by-sorm of do, a verb of the -no class.
Cf. nequinont:nequeunt, στόρνυ-μι, lino etc.

773. corde=anz'mo. Cor originally meant the intellectual part of a
mam cf. corde sapere Plaut. passim, Enn. egregie cordatus homo catus
A clius Sextus.

776. uelut: ‘sor example‚’ Most. 159, 862, Cure. 682 etc.

776. ministeriis. Corssen and Fleckeisen for MS. miseriis ,· praf-

fuleior, lit. ‘I arn used as a prop sor‚⁷ makes some change necessarys
‚ ministeriis is scanned mz'nstrz'z’s. Cf. Cure. 369 ministrabit, Stich. 689
ministremus, Epid. 111. 3. 39, Oscan mz‘nstrez's. So fenestra :sensnm
*monestrum=monstrum. We find a further stage of development in
Umbr. mestruzminz'strz‘‚ feslra Ennius, mostrum (from which the
dimin. mostellum), mostrare Plaut„ Alliesz's=Alliensis‚ Hortesia etc.
This reduction of the nasal was a peculiarity of colloquial Latin.

782. perbitere = perire. For bito cf. l. 2 5 5.

The pres. inf. is here used for the future. Cf. As. 439 aibat reddere,
Capt. 194 quo ire dixeram, Most. 621 dic te daturum ut abeat. Th. egon
dicam dare, infr. 1119 aibat arcessere, Stich. 391 negabam uendere. So
Lucr. 1. 726 hic Aetnea minantur murmura flammarum rursum se

not unfrequent in Cicero's letters, and in Caes. B. C. e.g. 111. 8. 3.
Further instances in Plaut. As. 604, Most. 1114, Men. 526, As. 597,
Ter. Eun. 520, Heaut. 7²4· Schmalz says that ‘the pres. inf. is used
in such cases to shew that one hopes that an action of which one knows
nothing has already begun and is still continuing,' Lat. Synt. p. 484.
But it is probable that in colloquial Latin, as is shewn by the instance
from Most. 621, both constructions were used with little distinction, the
infinitive being undefined and timeless‚ the notion of suturity being
sufficiently expressed by the verb. It will thus be parallel to such
instances in Greek as 11. 111. 366 τίσασθαι ἐφάμην, Ar. Nub. 1141
δικάσασθαί φασί μοι, where, in spite of Madvig’s elaborate criticisms in

Adv. Crit. 156 soll„ the aorist seems used without ἄν to express the
future idea.

786. fructus fullonius etc. Unintelligible as it stands, as we do
not know from what the metaphor is borrowed. Other readings are ’ζ
sucus and fluctus. The joke is obscure and probably obscene.

789. qui, ‘whereby my hand may be heavy‚’ i.e. money.
