time sor the action of the play, is thoroughly Greek, and was probably
taken directly by Plautus from some Greek original, probably not the
same original as that from which the main fabric of the play is taken.
In both the Middle and the New Comedy scenes made up of the
jests (σκώμματα) of eooks were very frequently introduced, so much so
that σκωπτικός was regularly applied to eooks in comedy, and their
jests, σκώμματα Μαισωνικά, were regarded according to Athenaeus
(180 A.D.) as a most important part of a comic poet's stock-in-trade.
The cook of comedy is usually distinguished for his bombastic talk
(ἀλαζονικὸν δ’ ἐστὶ πᾶν τὸ τῶν μαγείρων φῦλον, Athen. VII. 290, cf.
multz'locum gloriosum, l. 799), his great wisdom in cooking and other
arts, ζωγραφία, ἀστρολογικὴ, γεωμετρική, ἰατρική, are mentioned as
amongst his accomplishments in Athenaeus, and lastly for his lying
and thievish propensities‚ cf. 842, 854 etc. For other Cook-scenes in
the Palliatae cf. Curculio 2, Mercator 781, Aulularia 272 sqq.

795. forum οοᾳιιὶιιιιᾙιεμα-γειρεῖον, τόπον ὅθεν μισθοῦνται τοὺς μα.-
Ὑείρους Poll. lx. 48, macellum Plin. H. N. XV111. 11. 108. The
Athenians had no eooks attached to their households but hired them.
These hired eooks were mostly Sicilian slaves, whom their masters
let out for the day or longer; they brought their own utensils
(ornatus, pompa) and were usually accompanied by assistants or pupils
(dz'sczjulz') .

800. ut esset...qu1 coquat. For the sequence of tenses, which
though unclassical is frequent in Plautus, cf. Amph. 19² praemisit ut
nuntiem, Mil. 131 dedi mercatori qui ad illum deferat, Poen. 606 quasi
ta...0rauerzs„.ut commostraremus locum...ubz' ames, Capt. 997 upupa
. qui me delectem data est, Bacch. 3 52 ilafecz'...ut reddat, Amph. 484, 745,
Cist. Ι. 3. 20, Asin. 426 etc. The strict sequence of tenses did not exist
in colloquial Latin, ‘the tense is decided by the point of view which is
at the base of each individual sentence‚' and which of course varies just
as the human mind varies. The strict consecutio temporum is the result
of the strong desire for uniformity in the Roman mind, that desire for
law which shews itself in their language as well as their constitutions.
