NOTES. 115

vase-paintings of runners, cf. Maccoll and Harrison, Greek Vase-
paintings, pl. XXVII. In Greek the phrase is παρασείειν τὰς χεῖρας, or
simply παρασείσας (φεύγειν), Ar. Eth. N. 1v. 3. 15, Probl. v. 8. dimissis
manibus occurs also Epid. 447.

Ballio's play on the words is not very clear, it seems to be this,
847 odos dimissis manibus? i.e. ‘a smell hasn’t any hands'; the coquos
corrects himself and says ‘dimissis pedibus‚’ which appears to be a
phrase used of the crucifixion of slaves. Cf. Mil. 361 dispessis manibus
patibulum ferre.

Ussing regards ll. 847—848 as actor's gag now unintelligible.

851. istacine causa, i.e. to cook for Jupiter, not me.

852. fateor. Note the length of -ὖν, cf. uocb'r 1211, loquar Amph.
559, legcir morcir Rud. 1248. In old Latin this seems to have always
been the scansion. Historically‚ legar seems to have been built from
lega, on analogy of legitur and legem, which are forms supported by the
Sanskrit. Cf. Stolz in Miiller H. Β., p. 360. legor does not=leg0 se.

853. opera adpareat, ⁶ I take care that my activity is manifest ip

506 etc.

856. miluinis, i.e. rapacissimis, the kite, milszJs‚'1ater milub‘s, being
taken as a type of voracity. Cf. Men. ’κιο miluina, sesama.

857. coquinatum, we expect coquinatunz, cf. coqzcz’nurnforum, and
Aul. 400. Fleckeisen reads coqzcz‘tatum.

863. progredimmo. For this old imperative form of the second
pers. cf. opperimin0, arbitramzho, praefamine, Plaut. ’

868. conquiniscet. Cf. Cist. 484=t0 stoop down, ὡς ἀποπατῶν,
Ussing. -quino possibly connected with κινέω.

869. priuos = singulos. Cf. Lucr. V. 274 prinas mutantur in
horas.

873. Peliam, so Cic. Cat. ΙΙΙ. 23. 83 me haud facile quis re· ι
, traxerit nec tanquam Peliam recoxerit, but the usual tradition says that ’
it was Aeson not Pelias. Cf. Ov. Met. VII. 164.

8⁷4. uenenis, ‘potions‚’ ‘drugs.’

877. immo edepol uero, ‘nay‚ to be sure, by Pollux.’
