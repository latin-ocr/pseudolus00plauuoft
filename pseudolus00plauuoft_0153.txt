NOTES. 121

1095. bonan fide, ‘do you tell me that in good saith? i.e. ‘in
ear-nest) Ballio answers, ‘what have 1 to do with good faithP’ For a
similar play on words cf. Aul. 765, Pers. 486, Most. 655.

1096. contechinatus, for techinazre‘xv'r] cf. ἄναεῆῑωηατδραχμή,
and note on 87.

1098. in Sicyonem. Prepositions with names of places are common
in Plautus; cf. Bacch. 169 in Ephesum, cf. Curc. 341, 562, Mil. 113,
386 etc. Cf. Cic. Att. VII. 3. 10 uenio ad Piraeea, in quo magis uitu-
pcrandus sum quod homo Romanus Piraeea scripserim non Piraeeum...
quam quod in addiderim ; non enim lzoc ut oppido praeposui sed ut loco,
vid. Ussing on Bacch. 169.

1100. det nomen, ‘give in his name as joining the colony of “the
Mills”.'

Mola, or more usually molae,=the corn-mill driven by slaves; for
the custom at Rome of intending colonists giving in their names, vid.
Liv. Ι. 11. 4, 111. 1. 6 etc.

1102. nisi, ‘on1y,' vid. note on 108.

1103. nequam, ‘worthless‚⁷ indeclinable, prob.=77e-aequam. Cf.
As. 305 malus nequamque· Its opposite is fingi.

1104. nihili, ‘absolutely good-for-nothing,’ a stronger expression
than even nequam.

officium facere inmemor. This datival infinitive, denoting the
direction in which the adj. exerts its activity, is just parallel to the
verbal in -uzz Cf. Bacch. 62 istaec lepida sunt rilemoratzci, and a
somewhat similar dative is found in such expressions as propitiandis
numinibus accendunt altaria, Plin. H. N. XV. 135. The construction
is not found in Terence, or in classical or silver-age prose ; thus adding
another piece of testimony to shew the closeness of Terence's language
to Cicero rather than Plautus. The infin. with adjs. is however common
in all the poets of the Augustan age.

1105. ineo=in-l0c0 (in '‘stloco), ‘on the spot‚’ at once.

1107. luxantur, ἄπ. elp.=luxuriczntur‚ according to Festus, ‘men
who riot.'

lustrantur, Nonius lustrari dicimus et scortari, a lustris, ‘live in
¹ wanton revelry.' Cf. Cas. 11. 3. 26 in lustris iacere.

1110. teneant etc„ ‘nor is there a fragment of honest disposition
in their composition, unless it be the disposition of supporting them-

selves by shameless devices.’ The text is corrupt here. For tenere se
cf. As. 593, Merc. 1005.

1112. nobilis=notus‚ vid. 597, note.
