NOTES. 123

curuo is obscure, why ‘crooked’? possibly an allusion to the common
slave-punishment of breaking on the wheel. Leo takes it of a cudgel,
scip2'0,=⁷‘7 καμπύλη, cf. Rud. 833.

1147. in hunc intende digitum, i.e. medium, infamem, Persius 11.
33, or impudicum Mart. VI. 703 with which insulting and obscene
gestures were often made, cf. Mart. 11. 28, Juvenal X. 53. The sense is
‘turn your abuse on this sellow‚ not me.'

1148. For this legal outcry cf. note on 558.

1149. libella, vid. 98, note.

1151. accipias. The subjunctive has here its optative sorce3 it is
not necessary to actually supply uolo from the uis in the preceding
line.

⁸1:⁶2¹ ποτε, ‘on the chance that?

1152. lectae numeratae, asyndeton, ‘in hard cash and duly counted.'
Cf. Bacch. 969, Poen. 593, 712.

1153. hoc, although minae has preceded. Cf. id Bacch. 1026 of
ducenti nummi, Epid. 115 quadraginta minas...illud, Trin. 403, Cio.
Att.1v. 15. 7, XI. 11. 2.

iussit...ut, cf. Amph. 202 iubet sententiam ut dicant suam. The
subjunctive after iubeo without ut is much commoner, Most. 914,
Men. 935, Stich. 397 ete. Both constructions are rare in classical
Latin.

1161. diem multum esse. Cf. ad mullum diem, multa luce, multo
mane, cs. Introd. ξ 15. „-

1163. quid agimus, deliberative3 cf. Mil. 249, Most. 355 quid ago?
Cicero also uses this colloquialism in his letters, eg. Att. XVI. 7. 4 quid
respondemus ?

1164. iuxta cum, ‘those who are absolutely in the dark know as J
much about it as Ι (10.’ Cf. Aul. 674 (Ussing) iuxta mecum, ‘as well
as I'=mza cum me, so Sall. Cat. 58 iuxta mecum omnes intellzgitis,
Mil. 236, Pers. 250. iuxta is an adverb, and is exactly paralleled by
such uses as pariter, aeque mecum with the same meaning.

1168. commune, ‘we ought to share it.’ Ball. ‘Oh no, you may
have all—the punishment.’

1169. operam dare for ‘pay attention,' vid. 549, note.
