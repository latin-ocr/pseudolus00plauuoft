1207. hominem, the accusative of exclamation or specification.
The important position which the accusative case acquired in late
Latin is shewn by such uses as lzic quiescunt duas nostrates (Inscription
from Africa), and the fact that Romance language forms regularly
come from the accusative, e.g. pied: pedem, nuitmzoctem, rien=rem.
Similarly the Latins in transferring Greek words to their language
usually took the accusative, e.g.

’Axpd7avra= A gregrentum, Ἀκράγας nom.

Τάραντᾳ -- Tarentum, Τάρας nom.
Ζάκυνθον = Saguntum.

,κρηπῖδα =c7·epida, κρηπίς nom.
