APPENDIX A.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONSTRUCTIONS AS
ILLUSTRATED ΒΥ PLAUTUS.

A MAN‘S mind is full of ideas or combinations of ideas; these he
sometimes wishes to impart to others. To do this he has at his
command as means of communication (α) gesture, (β) depiction, (γ)
language.

Language then is one of the ways of expressing thought. Certain
ideas or relations of ideas arise in A ’s mind which he wishes to express
to B3 these ideas are as it were labelled, i.e. they are words, and we
may define a sentence (or breath-group) as ‘the linguistic expression of
a combination of ideas.' Sentences shade off into many variefies, eg.
command, wish, question etc. A combination of ideas may be expressed
by (ι) mere juxtaposition of its component parts, (2) gradation according

to emphasis (stress), (3) tone, (4) link-wordS„ (5) inflexion3 of these the
most important is tone.

In syntax, simple precedes complex, coordination or parataxis
(παράταξις) precedes subordination or hypotaxis (ὑπόταξις), as wesee
in every language‚ e.g.

Ι. I hear: you are ill. Parataxis.

11. I hear that: you are ill.
ΙΙΙ. 1 hear that you are ill. Hypotaxis.

Ι. The sun shines. We will go a walk.
ΙΙ. The sun shines, we will go a walk.
111. The sun shines therefore we will go a walk.

IV. Because the sun shines therefore we will go a walk.
