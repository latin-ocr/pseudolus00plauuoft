APPENDJX A. 143

1. δείδω. μή τι πάθῃσι. Ι am anxious. Let nothing happen
to him,

II. δείδω μή τι πάθῃσι.
1. sac. ueniat. Do it. Let him come.
11. fac ueniat.

III. fizc ut ueniat.

And so always; two sentences reciprocally determine each other, and
the sentence containing the idea which is most prominent to the
consciousness will become the main sentence, the other will be sub-
ordinated.

The Latin language had originally three moods: Indicative, Opta-
tive', Subjunctive. The optative however was merged in the subjunctive.
Note that these three moods could originally be all used independently.

The history of the Latin subjunctive may be approximately thus
given

Suhjunclive Optative

Ns

Potential (Cf. Pl. Cure. 632 quaeratis clamy-

l dem, ‘you'll be asking for my
Ι cloak next.')

Indefinite assumption with weak future.

Wish Hortative
Ι Jussive } according to lone.
ψ Optative
Concessive

Smnmary.

Thus we may say that the Latin subjunctive is a mood which could
stand independently, conveying the idea os a weak indefinite future
where there was any idea of limitation, conception etc.‚ and was thus
by nature suitable for subordinate sentences. These subordinate sen-
tences develop themselves by (a) tone, (b) link-wordS, conjunctional
particles added to strengthen the meaning. An instance from Homer,
although properly speaking hypotactic‚ looked at historically, will make
this clear.

Od. XV. 31¹

ἡγεμόν’ ἐσθλὸν ὄπασσον ὃς κε’ με 'cefff’ ἀγάγῃ.
