We may imagine these stages:

Ι. ὄπασσον· ὃς ἀγάγῃ, ‘he...shall lead.’
II. ὄπασσον· ὅς κε ἀγάγῃ, subjunctive with modifying particle κε.

ΙΙΙ. ὄπασσον ὅς κε ἀγάγῃ, ὅς passing from ‘he’ to ‘who,' and κε
ἀγάγῃ passing from weak future to a colourless mood of
subordination.

So the development of the hypotaxis depends on two sactors which
gradually change their characteristies: (1) the prominent link-word ὅς
changes from anaphoric to relative, (2) the mood changes from weak
future to a mere mood of limitation.

To come to the construetions in detail.
Subordinate thought deals with
(α) Intention of speaker3 final.
(β) Conditions of action.
(γ) Resu'lt of action. Consecutive.
Final and kindred sentences (i.e. modal and constructions of ‘sear-
ing ’) arise from a command or wish, with the aid of strengthening

particles‚ which took on themselves special functions, but frequently
retained their old sunction in other collocations‚ e. g.

I. cures, ‘look to it.’

II. ut cures, lit. ‘in some way or other look to it.’
Cf. Pl. passim ut le di perduint ‚· ut=uti= *cutzz From stem quo· in qui,
quis etc. cf. ubi, (ali)cubz· etc.

III. uide ut cures. Complete hypotaxis.
Cf. Ps. 49 faxo scies, note, 210, 390, 766, cf. Amph. 976 (Ussing’s
note).
Similarly
I. uiros mitto. qui hocfacz'ent‚ ‘ will do it!
ΙΙ. uiros mitto. qui lzocsaciant.

I. iube. ueniat, ‘tell him. Let him come.'
11. iube ueniat.
ΙΙΙ. iube ut ueniat.

Cf. Pseud. 1054 iube ueniat, ib. 1061 uelim ueniat.
Cf. 11. 11. 363
