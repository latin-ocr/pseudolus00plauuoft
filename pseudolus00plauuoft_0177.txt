APPENDJX A. 145

ὣς (Idg. ζα, Skt. ya-) originally=‘in this way‚’ then ⁴ in which way.’
ne sentences.
ne facias, a prohibition, is the starting-point sor iubeo ne facias.

Cf. Ter. Haut. 783 ita tu istaec miscet0‚· ne me admisceas, pure
parataxis, ‘don’t mix up me in the matter’ ; the connection between the
sentences becoming closer, we may translate ‘that you may not’...‘lest
you' etc.

So in Greek.

11. 11. 470 δείδω μή τι πάθῃσιν etc., vid. supr.

Consecutive.

The development of consecutive constructions is very similar to that
of final ς osten only distinct by the context.
Examples: Men. 572

habent hunc morem argentarii: cluentes sibi uolunt multos.
Il. 111. 286 τιμὴν δ’ Ἀργείοις ἀποτινέμεν...ἥ τε πέληται.

The subjunctive is used in consecutive sentences ‘as being the only
mood which can shew that the action of the main sentence is limited by
the circumstances which accompany or follow the subordinate sentence.’
Schmalz.

Double questions.
Originally two deliberative independent sentences

Ι. maneam an abeam ?
11. maneam an abeam ? nescio.

ΙΙΙ. nescio maneam an abeam, often with the addition of some ’
other particle -ne, etc.

Pseud. 713 gives an instance of ulrum...ne...an used of two alter-
natives,

dic utrum Spemne an Salutem te salutem.

utrum here goes back to its original meaning, a neuter pronoun,
dic utrum faciam, etc., ‘tell’ me which of the two things Ι shall do '....
Later it became merely a particle, like Gk πότερον, the pronominal
nature being lost. For a parallel development compare that of quod or
ὅτι, English tlzat, German dass etc.

Condz'tz'ons and Concessions.

When sentences of wish become logically dependent they pass into
the designation of the condition or concession.
