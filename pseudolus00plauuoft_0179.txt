APPENDIX B.

PLAUTUS AND THE ROMANCE LANGUAGES.

The Romance languages are derived, not from the classical Latin
of Cicero and Vergil, but from the popular Latin which was the ordinary
medium of conversation among all classes at Rome. This sermo plebeius,
cotidianus, rusticus, uulgaris, as it was called, was recognised as distinet
by the Romans themselves; it had its own laws, and was not subject to
the influence of changing literary fashions. This continuity of colloquial
Latin is hard to realise owing to the paucity of literary evidence, but it
is none the less real on that account. When we find certain sounds or
forms or methods of expression occurring in Archaic Latin, and only
re-appearing again in late vulgar Latin and the Romance languages, it
is not a ‘ renaissance’ or an ‘archaising tendency‚’ but merely the sermo
plebeius, which had continued in use all the time, making itself felt in
literature. To rightly understand the history of the Romance languages
we need to know something of this colloquial Latin. A proper study
of Plautus and his language assists us in reconstructing this source of the
more modern idioms, and moreover, by caresul comparison, helps us to
assign to Plautus his right place in Roman literature. It may be men-
tioned too that in several cases the peculiarities of Plautine usages can
only be satisfactorily explained by a caret'ul study of similar constructions
in the derived languages.

The relations os the Romance languages may be thus shewn.
