148 PSE UDOL US.

The peculiarities of the sermo plebeius have been ascertained fairly
accurately by comparison os the various derived dialects, and by close
investigation of the more colloquial Latin authors such as Plautus,
Cicero’s Letters‚ Petronius. For details vid. Gr'ober, Grundriss der
Romanischen Philologie, p. 356 seqq. Here only those peculiarities
are touched οη, of which examples occur in the Pseudolus, and a short
conspectus of them is given under the four heads of (A) Phonetics,
(B) Vocabulary, (C) Grammar, (D) Metre and Spelling.

A. Pnonnrrcs.

Romance words are usually derived from the accusative in Latin3
however the final -m very soon disappeared and murum, portam,
consuetudinem were reduced to muro, porta, consuetudine: mur, port,
coutume, cf. nuit, homme, pauvre, mon, etc. In Plautus we find this
final -m neglected in the scansion, being virtually already absent, e.g.
enz'm, nk‘mpe, parum etc. Final -m is often omitted in the older Latin
inscriptions, e-g. lzonc oino=lzunc unum, vid. Ps. l. 1203, note.

The pronunciation of vowels in colloquial Latin varied very much,
especially that of e-, u· and o— sounds ; and in the later Christian poets
we have evidence of a similar uncertainty. Cf. dqfrudes=desraudes,
1. 94. -o- is also frequent for —au-. Cf. the poet’s own name which was
originally the Umbrian Plotus, changed on his migration to Rome into
Plautus, which would be the fashionable pronunciation. This Umbrian
-o-, for which cf. inscriptions, e.g. Fostlus=Faustulus, forced itself into
Latin, but was considered vulgar. Cf. coda=cauda‚ Cato (Span. coda),
coles=caules, orata=aurala, plostrum :plaustrum ; thus we have Ital.
oro, toro = tauru(m)‚ cosa = causa.

Vulgar Latin and its derivatives‚ owing to the play of accent, drop
short vowels (especially o and u) before l ete. Of this we have in·
numerable instances, vid. poplus :peuple‚ l. 1273 cf. Fostlus=Faustulus,
uz‘nclo(m)‚ periclem. Fr. pe‘rz'l, caldus, Fr. chauci, It. cala'o, senuclo(m),
Fr. fenouzl, soldus, valde, altra, It. altro, Fr. autre (1. 358, note).
